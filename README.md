# The Systems Musings Club

We gather once a week to chat about systems topics, on Tuesdays at 10:30-11:30am ET, meeting on zoom. 
Please skim the "top" topic in [topics.md](./topics.md) before the meeting, and make sure to add to the list of potential topics!
We lost about 8 months of topics as we weren't maintaining records.
