# The Systems Musings Club

We gather once a week to chat about systems topics, on Mondays at 10:30-11:30am ET. 
We don't typically prepare, and instead discuss some issue together, often chosen at the start of the get-together.
See the topics.md file for some example topics.
We lost about 8 months of topics as we weren't maintaining records.
